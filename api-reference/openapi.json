See [Importing the m3ter Open API](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/m3ter-apis/getting-started-with-api-calls#importing-the-m3ter-open-api) in our main user Documentation for details.\n- Copy this link: [m3ter-Template API Collection](https://www.datocms-assets.com/78893/1672846767-m3ter-template-api-collection-postman_collection.json) and use it to import the **m3ter-Template API Collection** into your Workspace. See [Importing the m3ter Template API Collection](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/m3ter-apis/getting-started-with-api-calls#importing-the-m3ter-template-api-collection) in our main user Documentation for details.\n\n---\n\n# Introduction\nThe m3ter platform supports two HTTP-based REST APIs returning JSON encoded responses:\n- The **Ingest API**, which you can use for submitting raw data measurements. *(See the [Submit Measurements](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/api#tag/Measurements/operation/SubmitMeasurements) endpoint in this API Reference.)*\n- The **Config API**, which you can use for configuration and management. *(All other endpoints in this API Reference.)* \n\n## Authentication and Authorization\nOur APIs use an industry-standard authorization protocol known as the OAuth 2.0 specification.\n\nOAuth2 supports several grant types, each designed for a specific use case. m3ter uses the following two grant types:\n  - **Authorization Code**: Used for human login access via the m3ter Console.\n  - **Client Credentials**: Used for machine-to-machine communication and API access.\n\nComplete the following flow for API access:\n\n1. **Create a Service User and add Permissions**: Log in to the m3ter Console, go to **Settings**, **Access** then **Service Users** tab, and create a Service User. To enable API calls, grant the user **Administrator** permissions. \n    \n2. **Generate Access Keys**: In the Console, open the *Overview* page for the Service User by clicking on the name. Generate an **Access Key id** and **Api Secret**. Make sure you copy the **Api Secret** because it is only visible at the time of creation. \n\nSee [Service Authentication](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/authenticating-with-the-platform/service-authentication) for detailed instructions and an example.\n\n3. **Obtain a Bearer Token using Basic Auth**: We implement the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant authentication flow for Service User Authentication. Submit a request to the m3ter OAuth Client Credentials authentication flow, using your concatenated **Access Key id** and **Api Secret** to obtain a Bearer Token for your Service User. *See examples below.* \n \n4. **Bearer Token Usage**: Use the HTTP 'Authorization' header with the bearer token to authorise all subsequent API requests.  \n\n> Warning: The Bearer Token is valid for 18,000 seconds or 5 hours. When the token has expired, you must obtain a new one.\n\nBelow are two examples for obtaining a Bearer Token using Basic Auth: the first in cURL and the second as a Python script. \n\n### cURL Example\n1. Open your terminal or command prompt.    \n2. Use the following `cURL` command to obtain a Bearer Token:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://api.m3ter.com/oauth/token \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  -u your_access_key_id:your_api_secret \\\n  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials'\n```\n\nReplace `your_access_key_id` and `your_api_secret` with your actual **Access Key id** and **Api Secret**.\n\n3.  Run the command, and if successful, it will return a JSON response containing the Bearer Token. The response will look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"your_bearer_token\",\n  \"token_type\": \"Bearer\",\n  \"expires_in\": 18000\n}\n```\n\nYou can then use the Bearer Token *(the value of `\"access_token\"`)* for subsequent API calls to m3ter.\n\n### Python Example\n1. Install the `requests` library if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\n2. Use the following Python script to obtain a Bearer Token:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport base64\n\n# Replace these with your Access Key id and Api Secret\naccess_key_id = 'your_access_key_id'\napi_secret = 'your_api_secret'\n\n# Encode the Access Key id and Api Secret in base64 format\ncredentials = base64.b64encode(f'{access_key_id}:{api_secret}'.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')\n\n# Set the m3ter token endpoint URL\ntoken_url = 'https://api.m3ter.com/oauth/token'\n\n# Set the headers for the request\nheaders = {\n    'Authorization': f'Basic {credentials}',\n    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'\n}\n\n# Set the payload for the request\npayload = {\n    'grant_type': 'client_credentials'\n}\n\n# Send the request to obtain the Bearer Token\nresponse = requests.post(token_url, headers=headers, data=payload)\n\n# Check if the request was successful\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    # Extract the Bearer Token from the response\n    bearer_token = response.json()['access_token']\n    print(f'Bearer Token: {bearer_token}')\nelse:\n    print(f'Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}')\n```\n\nReplace `your_access_key_id` and `your_api_secret` with your actual **Access Key id** and **Api Secret**. \n\n3. Run the script, and if successful, it will print the Bearer Token. You can then use this Bearer Token for subsequent API calls to m3ter.\n\n## Submitting Personally Identifiable Information (PII)\n**IMPORTANT!** Under the [Data Processing Agreement](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/legal/dpa), the only fields permissible for use in submitting any of your end-customer PII data in m3ter are the ``name``, ``address``, and ``emailAddress`` fields on the **Account** entity - see the details for [Create Account](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/api#operation/PostAccount). See also section 4.2 of the [Terms of Service](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/legal/terms-of-service).\n\n## Rate and Payload Limits\n### Config API Request Rate Limits\nSee [Config API Limits](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/m3ter-apis/config-api-limits).\n\n### Data Explorer API Request Rate Limits\nSee [Data Explorer Request Rate Limits](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/m3ter-apis/config-api-limits#date-explorer-request-rate-limits).\n\n### Ingest API Request Rate and Payload Limits\nSee [Ingest API Limits](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/m3ter-apis/ingest-api-limits) for more information.\n\n## Pagination\n**List Endpoints**\nAPI endpoints that have a List resources request support cursor-based pagination - for example, the `List Accounts` request. These List calls support pagination by taking the two parameters `pageSize` and `nextToken`. \n\nThe response of a List API call is a single page list. If the `nextToken` parameter is not supplied, the first page returned contains the newest objects chronologically. Specify a `nextToken` to retrieve the page of older objects that occur immediately after the last object on the previous page.\n\nUse `pageSize` to limit the list results per page, typically this allows up to a maximum of 100 or 200 per page.\n\n**Search Endpoints**\nAPI endpoints that have a Search resources request support cursor-based pagination - for example, the `Search Accounts` request. These Search calls support pagination by taking the two parameters `pageSize` and `fromDocument`.\n\nThe response of a Search API call is a single page list. If the `fromDocument` parameter is not supplied, the first page returned contains the newest objects chronologically. Specify a `fromDocument` to retrieve the page of older objects that occur immediately after the last object on the previous page.\n\nUse `pageSize` to limit the list results per page, typically this allows up to a maximum of 100 or 200 per page. Default is 10.\n\n## API Quick Start\nSee [Getting Started with API Calls](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/m3ter-apis/getting-started-with-api-calls) for detailed guidance on how to use our API to:\n* Create a Service User and add permissions.\n* Generate access keys for the Service User.\n* Use basic authentication to obtain a Bearer Token.\n\nFor further guidance, also see [Creating and Configuring Service Users](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/organization-and-access-management/managing-users/creating-and-configuring-service-users).\n\n## Other Languages\nIf you want to work with the m3ter REST APIs using other languages such as:\n* Python\n* JavaScript\n* C++\n\nPlease see the [Developer Tools](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/developer-tools) topic in our main documentation for information about available SDKs.\n\n\n# Authentication\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->",

    "description" : "This section provides Endpoints for operations that allow you to retrieve detailed information about individual Events, list all Events or specific Event Types, and explore dynamic fields available for each Event Type.\n\nEvents encompass specific instances of state changes within the system, such as the creation of a new Prepayment/Commitment for an Account. Each Event is classified under an Event Type framework, providing context about what kind of change occurred to generate the Event.\n\n**Events for Configuration and Billing Entities**\n\nMany Event Types cover common configuration and billing objects, where the Event is generated for a state change of one of these objects - for when the configuration or billing object is **created**, **deleted**, or **updated**. \n\nFor example:\n* configuration.commitment.created\n* configuration.commitment.deleted\n* configuration.commitment.updated\n* configuration.account.created\n* configuration.account.deleted\n* configuration.account.updated\n* billing.bill.created\n* billing.bill.deleted\n* billing.bill.created\n\n**Events for Errors or Failures** \n\nThere are also Event Types for certain kinds of error that can occur:\n\n* For an Integration:\n  * validation\n  * authentication\n  * perform\n  * missing account mapping\n  * disabled\n\n* For a Usage Data Ingest Submission:\n  * validation failure\n\n* For Data Export Jobs:\n  * data export job failure\n\n**Scheduled Events**\n\nIn addition to system-generated Events that occur when a configuration entity undergoes a state change at creation, update, or deletion of the entity, you can use API calls to create and configure *Scheduled Event Configurations*. Scheduled Events are custom Event types, which you can set up by referencing Date/Time fields on configuration and billing entities. See the [ScheduledEventConfigurations](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/api#tag/ScheduledEventConfigurations) section of this API Reference for more details.\n\n**Notifications for Events**\n\nYou can create Notification rules based on Events and these rules can reference and apply calculations to the Event's fields. This allows you to set up customized alerts to be sent out via webhooks when the Event occurs and any conditions you've built into the Notification rule's calculation are satisfied.\n\nSee the [Notifications](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/api#tag/Notifications) section for more details.\n\n**Other Events**\n\nWhen Events occur, they can cause other Events, such as when a Notification is triggered by the Event it is based on. For these Events there are currently two categories:\n* Notification\n* IntegrationEvent\n\nAlso see [Utilizing Events and Notifications](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/utilizing-events-and-notifications) and [Object Definitions and API Calls](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/utilizing-events-and-notifications/object-definitions-and-api-calls) in the m3ter documentation for more guidance.\n"

You might also want to aggregate raw data measures for other purposes, such as to feed into analytical or business performance tools.\n\n**Notes:**\n* **Contrast with Compound Aggregations**. Standard or simple Aggregations of this type, which apply an aggregation method directly to Meter usage data fields, are contrasted with [Compound Aggregations](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/api#tag/CompoundAggregation). A Compound Aggregation typically references one or more simple Aggregations and applies a calculation to them to derive pricing metrics needed to serve more complex usage-based pricing scenarios.\n* **Segmented Aggregations**. Segmented Aggregations allow you to segment the usage data collected by a single Meter. This capability is very useful for implementing some pricing and billing use cases.

Having this capability to store data in a free-hand fashion can prove very useful in helping you to meet specific usage-based pricing and other operational business use cases.\n\nHowever, you can exploit the values stored on Custom Fields in a more direct way by referencing them in Derived Field and Compound Aggregation calculations. Given the key role these calculations can play when implementing usage-based pricing schema, any Custom Fields you reference will then affect how the platform behaves. Referencing Custom Field values in your calculations offers a much wider scope of options when it comes to resolving complex usage-based pricing use cases.\n\nCustom Fields can be added to the following entities at Organizational level:\n* Organization\n* Account\n* AccountPlan\n* Aggregation\n* Compound Aggregation\n* Meter\n* Product\n* Plan\n* PlanTemplate\n* Contract\n\nThese all follow the same pattern - a new *(optional)* field is available on the entity request and response bodies called \"customFields\" which is a object in this format:\n```\n\"customFields\": {\n\t\t\"exampleCustomField1\": 7.1,\n\t\t\"exampleCustomField2\": \"stringValue\"\n}\n```\nThe value for a Custom Field can be a string or a number.\n\n**Using Custom Field values in calculations:**\n- You can add Custom Fields at two levels - the Organization level and the individual entity level.\n- The Organizational level field provides a default value and *must be added* if you want to also add a Custom Field of the same name at the corresponding individual entity level. If you reference the Custom Field in a calculation, the value for the individual entity level field is used. If no field is defined at individual entity level, then the Organization level field value is used.\n\n**Important: Constraints and Exceptions!**\n\n**Custom Fields at Organization Level**. Currently, you cannot create Custom Fields at the Organization-level for the following enitites:\n* Plan Group\n* Balance\n* Balance Transaction Schedule\n* Balance Charge Schedule\n\nTherefore you cannot reference the Custom Fields values created at the individual entity level for these entities in your Derived Field or Compound Aggregation calculations.\n\n\n**Derived Field Calculations**. You can *only reference Custom Fields* for the following entities:\n* Organization\n* Meter\n* Account\n\nHowever, if you are using Meters belonging to *a specific Product*, that is, not *Global Meters*, you can also reference Custom Fields added to a Product in Derived Field calculations.\n\n**Compound Aggregation Calculations - Meter Custom Fields**.

You can include options to top-up the original Balance.\n\nExamples of how Balances for end customer Accounts can be used:\n\n* Onboarding Balance/Free Trials. Offering an onboarding incentive to new customers as an initial free credit Balance on their Account. \n\n* Balance as initial commitment. Add a Balance amount to a new customer Account. This acts as an initial commitment, which allows them to use the service and gain an accurate insight into their usage level. \n\n* Managing Customer Satisfaction. Use Balance as credits that will be applied to subsequent Bills as compensation for acknowledged service delivery issues.\n\n* Facilitating Balance Adjustments:\n\t* Apply negative amounts to immediately write-off outstanding Balances.\n\n#### What is the difference between Balances and Commitments/Prepayments?\n\nTo manage credit amounts for your end-customer Accounts, you can use Balances or Commitments/Prepayments. However, these two kinds of credits for Accounts serve different purposes.\n\nCommitments - also referred to as Prepayments - are used for amounts end-customers have agreed to pay for consuming your product or services across a full contract term. A customer might pay the entire or only part of the agreed amount upfront, but ***the commitment or prepayment amount is payable regardless of the actual usage by the customer of your service or product.***\n\nIn contrast, a Balance - often referred to as a Top-Up or Prepaid draw-down - is used when a customer wants to add a credit amount to their Account at any time during the service period or when you as service provider want to add a credit to a customer Account. This Balance credit can then be drawn-down against for billing the Account for usage, minimum spend, standing charges, or recurring charges due. Balances therefore serve payment use cases in a more flexible way, for example to be used for a \"Free Credit\" sign-up scheme you offer to encourage sales or to enhance customer satisfaction by adding credit to an Account to compensate for service delivery issues.\n\nYou can use Commitments/Prepayments and Balances together on Account, and define at Organization or individual Account level the order in which any Balance/Commitment credit on an Account is drawn-down - Balance amounts first or Commitment/Prepayment amounts first.  \n"

Set start and end dates to define the period the AccountPlan is active for the Account.\n* **AccountPlan per Product**. If an end customer consumes multiple Products, create separate AccountPlans to charge for each Product.\n\n**AccountPlan Constraints:**\n* Only one AccountPlan per Product can be active at any one time for an Account.\n* If you create a Plan as a custom Plan for a specific Account, you can only use it to create an AccountPlan for that Account.\n\n**AccountPlanGroups**\nPlan Groups are used when you want to apply a minimum spend amount at billing across several of your Products each of which are priced separately - when you create the Plan Group, you define an overall minimum spend and then add any priced Plans you want to include in the Group. To create an AccounPlanGroup, you can attach a Plan Group to an Account that consumes the separate Products which are priced using the included Plans.

For example, a Plan can be assigned to Plan ResourceGroups, a Meter can be assigned to Meter ResourceGroups, and so on. This is useful for cases where you want to create Permission Policies which allow or deny access to a specific subset of resources. For example, grant a user access to only some of the Plans in your Organization.\n\nThis concept of grouping resources applies to every resource in m3ter, including ResourceGroups themselves.

However, these two kinds of credits for Accounts serve different purposes.\n\nCommitments/Prepayments are used for amounts end-customers have agreed to pay for consuming your product or services across a full contract term. A customer might pay the entire or only part of the agreed amount upfront, but ***the prepayment amount is payable regardless of the actual usage by the customer of your service or product.***\n\nIn contrast, a Balance - often referred to as a Top-Up or Prepaid draw-down - is used when a customer wants to add a credit amount to their Account at any time during the service period or when you as service provider want to add a credit to a customer Account. This Balance credit can then be drawn-down against for billing the Account for usage, minimum spend, standing charges, or recurring charges due. Balances therefore serve payment use cases in a more flexible way, for example to be used for a \"Free Credit\" sign-up scheme you offer to encourage sales or to enhance customer satisfaction by adding credit to an Account to compensate for service delivery issues.\n\nYou can use Prepayments/Commitments and Balances together on Account, and define at Organization or individual Account level the order in which any Balance/Prepayment credit on an Account is drawn-down - Balance amounts first or Prepayment amounts first.\n\n#### Billing for Commitments \n\nIf not all of an agreed Commitment amount is paid at the start of an end-customer contract period, you can choose one of two options for billing the outstanding fees due on the customer Account:\n- Select a Product *Plan to bill with*.\n- Define a *schedule of billing dates*."

The maximum size of the payload needs to be less than 512,000 bytes.\n\n**NOTES:**\n* **Non-existent Accounts.** The `account` request parameter is required. However, if you want to submit a usage data measurement for an Account which does not yet exist in your Organization, you can use an `account` code for a non-existent Account. A new skeleton Account will be automatically created. The usage data measurement is accepted and ingested as data belonging to the new auto-created Account. At a later date, you can edit the Account's Code,??Name, and??e-mail address. For more details, see [Submitting Usage Data for Non-Existent Accounts](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/billing-and-usage-data/submitting-usage-data/submitting-usage-data-for-non-existent-accounts) in our main documentation.\n* **Usage Data Adjustments.** If you need to make corrections for billing retrospectively against an Account, you can use date/time values in the past for the `ts` (timestamp) request parameter to submit positive or negative usage data amounts to correct and reconcile earlier billing anomalies. For more details, see [Submitting Usage Data Adjustments Using Timestamp](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/billing-and-usage-data/submitting-usage-data/submitting-usage-data-adjustments-using-timestamp) in our main documentation.\n* **Ingest Validation Failure Events.** After the intial submission of a usage data measurement to the Ingest API, a data enrichment stage is performed to check for any errors in the usage data measurement, such as a missing field. If an error is identified, this might result in the submission being rejected. In these cases, an *ingest validation failure* Event is generated, which you can review on the [Ingest Events](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/billing-and-usage-data/submitting-usage-data/reviewing-and-resolving-ingest-events) page in the Console. See also the [Events](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/api#tag/Events) section in this API Reference.\n\n**IMPORTANT! - Use of PII:** The use of any of your end-customers' Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in m3ter is restricted to a few fields on the **Account** entity. Please ensure that any measurements you submit do not contain any end-customer PII data. See the [Introduction section](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/api#section/Introduction) above for more details.",

Each ad-hoc Export can be configured for exporting *only one of* either Usage or Operational data:\n\n**Operational Data Exports**.\n* **Entity Types**. Use the `operationalDataTypes` parameter to specify the entities whose operational data you want to include in the ad-hoc export.\n* **Export Files**. For each of the entity types you select, when the ad-hoc export runs a separate file is compiled containing the operational data for all entities of that type that exist in your Organization\n\n**Usage Data Exports**.\n* Select the Meters and Accounts whose usage data you want to include in the ad-hoc export.\n* You can use the `dimensionFilters` parameter to filter the usage data returned for export by adding specific values of non-numeric Dimension data fields on included Meters. Only the data collected for the values you've added for the selected Dimension fields will be included in the export.\n* You can use the `aggregations` to apply aggregation methods the usage data returned for export. This restricts the range of usage data returned for export to only the data collected by aggregated fields on selected Meters. Nothing is returned for any non-aggregated fields on Meters. The usage data for Meter fields is returned as the values resulting from applying the selected aggregation method. See the [Aggregations for Queries - Options and Consequences](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/data-explorer/usage-data-explorer-v2#aggregations-for-queries---understanding-options-and-consequences) for more details.\n* If you've applied `aggregations` to the usage returned for export, you can then use the `groups` parameter to group the data by *Account*, *Dimension*, or *Time*.\n\n**Date Range for Operational Data Exports**. To restrict the operational data included in the ad-hoc export by a date/time range, use the `startDate` date/time request parameter to specify the start of the time period. The export will include all operational data from the specified `startDate` up until the date/time the export job runs.\n\n**Date Range for Usage Data Exports**. To restrict the usage data included in the ad-hoc export by date/time range, use the `startDate` and `endDate` date/time parameters:\n* Both `startDate` and `endDate` are required.\n* `endDate` must be after `startDate`.\n* `endDate` cannot be after tomorrow at midnight UTC. For example if today is May 20th 2025, you can only choose `endDate` to be equal or before 2025-05-21T00:00:00.000Z.\n\n**NOTE:** You can use the ExportJob `id` returned to check the status of the triggered ad-hoc export.

Having access to reference both `new` and `old` Field values for an object can be very useful if you want to base a Notification rule on an Event and include a calculation in the rule that, for example, compares `new` values with `old` - for example, trigger a Notification only when a Commitment has been updated and the `new` value for the `amount` is at least $1,000 greater than the `old` value.\n- Some Event types will show `customFields` even though the specific billing or configuration object the Event is for does not yet have the custom fields functionality implemented. For these Events, their `customFields` values will not be populated until such time as the custom fields functionality is implemented for them",
